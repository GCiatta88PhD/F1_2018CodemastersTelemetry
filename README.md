# F1_2018CodemastersTelemetry
In this work, I use some Matlab code to read the UDP telemetry data coming from F1 2018 Game.

Use the app to read the UDP packets, the saved ".mat" can be transformed by the others scripts. 
The ATLAS conversion script can convert the .mat in a version readable with the ATLAS telemetry system.
